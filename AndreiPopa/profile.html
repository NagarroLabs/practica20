                    <p>Having a website means customers are always able to find you – anytime, anywhere. Even outside of
                        business hours, your website continues to find and secure new customers. It offers the user
                        convenience as they can access the information they need in the comfort of their own home, with
                        no
                        added pressure to buy. Plus, as most companies nowadays have their own website, there’s every
                        chance
                        you could be losing customers to your competitors by staying offline</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In today’s modern world, there is an expectation for any reputable company to have some kind of
                        online presence. Potential customers would likely be distrusting of any business that didn't
                        have a
                        telephone number or a physical address, and the same can be said for not having a website and
                        email
                        address. These are useful tools to share crucial information about your business with customers
                        and
                        answer all the What’s and Why’s that they may have. What’s more, having a good quality,
                        easy-to-use
                        website makes customers feel comfortable using your services, as they will assume they can
                        expect
                        the same positive experience in all areas of your business.</p>
